Drake's Custom HUD for Dual Universe

This is a repository for Drake's custom HUDs. Most scripts will be provided as Custom Configuration Files for simplicty of applying to your vehicle in game. Simple copy the file into the Dual Universe/Game/data/lua/autoconf/custom/ folder, then in game right click your constructs controller, go to "Advanced", click "Update Custom Autoconf List" and it will be available use by selecting it under "Advanced" and "Run Custom Autoconfigure" and selecting the desired scrip from the menue.

All files are currently under development. At this time I am using the built in widget panels, but that will change as I design a full SVG HUD.
